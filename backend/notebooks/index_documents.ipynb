Unfortunately, I can't discuss SkySafari Legacy because it is no longer available for download. The other SkySafari versions are paid, and in this article, I only cover free applications that I use.\n",

    "\n",
    "            *A view of the Scorpius constellation as seen from Sky Tonight.*\n",
    "\n",
    "            `Sky Tonight` is a free planetarium application developed by [Vito Technology](https://vitotechnology.com/) and is available on both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vitotechnology.sky.tonight.map.star.walk&referrer=utm_source%3Dvitosite%26utm_medium%3Dsky-tonight%26utm_campaign%3Dproduct) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sky-tonight-stargazing-guide/id1570594940). Vito Technology has also developed other applications, such as [Star Walk 2](https://starwalk.space/en), which I used previously. However, since the launch of Sky Tonight, I have switched to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "            I love the graphics and user interface of Sky Tonight. The application has many features that I will discuss below.\n",
    "\n",
    "            #### Calendar\n",
    "\n",
    "            To use the calendar feature, tap the `calendar` icon on the main screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "            *The **calendar** button in Sky Tonight opens the calendar view.*\n",
    "\n",
    "            The calendar displays a list of interesting celestial events happening today, and you can also select any future date to see upcoming events for that day. Unlike Stellarium, you can't filter events by category or magnitude, but you can view all events by selecting a date.\n",
    "\n",
    "            *The calendar in Sky Tonight shows celestial events for the selected date.*\n",
    "\n",
    "            The calendar also shows [moon phases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase). When you tap on a date, you'll see detailed information about the moon phase for that day, including age, illumination, angular size, magnitude, rise and set times, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "            *Detailed information about the moon phase in Sky Tonight.*\n",
    "\n",
    "            There is a tab for meteor showers you can observe, and another tab that provides information about the sky, such as the length of the day, total darkness start and end times, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "            *The **meteor showers** and **sky details** tabs in Sky Tonight.*\n",
    "\n",
    "            You can also use the `share` button to send calendar information to your friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "            *The **share** button in Sky Tonight allows you to share celestial event information.*\n",
    "\n",
    "            #### Stargazing index\n",
    "\n",
    "            To use this feature, click on the telescope icon at the bottom of the screen in the main view.\n",
    "\n",
    "            *The **Visible Tonight** icon in Sky Tonight.*\n",
    "\n",
    "            The `Stargazing index` feature gathers information about the start and end of the night, the moon phase, light pollution, and the percentage of cloudiness. All of this data is combined to give you a final score from 0 to 100%. A higher score means better conditions for stargazing.\n",
    "\n",
    "            *The **Stargazing index** in Sky Tonight provides a score based on various factors affecting stargazing conditions.*\n",
    "\n",
    "            You can adjust the forecast horizon to see how the stargazing index changes over time. This is helpful for planning your stargazing sessions. You can choose between `1 day`, `3 days`, or `7 days`. When you select 3 days or 7 days, additional tabs appear, one for each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "            *You can change the forecast horizon in the **Stargazing index** feature of Sky Tonight.*\n",
    "\n",
    "            #### Stargazing news\n",
    "\n",
    "            The team behind Sky Tonight regularly publishes articles and quizzes about astronomy. You can find these by clicking the hamburger menu icon, then selecting the `Stargazing news` option.\n",
    "\n",
    "            They also create beautiful infographics. I really enjoy reading these articles and taking the quizzes.\n",
    "\n",
    "            *The **Stargazing news** section in Sky Tonight provides articles and quizzes about astronomy.*\n",
    "\n",
    "            ### Other applications\n",
    "\n",
    "            I have also used other planetarium applications like `Star Walk 2`, `SkyView`, and several others. While I no longer use them, they are still solid options. You can try them out and see which one you like best.\n",
    "\n",
    "            -----\n",
    "\n",
    "            ## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "            Exploring the night sky is incredibly easy with free planetarium applications. Over time, I’ve tried many of these applications on both my computer and my phone, and each one has taught me something new about the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "            If you have not already, I encourage you to try some of these tools. You might be surprised by how much you can learn, and how much fun you will have just by looking up.\n",
