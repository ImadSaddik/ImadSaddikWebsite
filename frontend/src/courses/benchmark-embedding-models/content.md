## Course Overview

In this course, you will learn the limitations of extracting text from PDF files with Python libraries and how to solve that with the help of VLMs (Vision Language Models).

We will cover how to divide the extracted text into chunks that preserve context and generate questions for each chunk using LLMs (Large Language Models). You will learn to use embedding models to create vector representations of the chunks and questions, utilizing both open source and proprietary embedding models.

You'll also discover how to use [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) to run models in the GGUF format locally on your machine. We will perform benchmarking of different embedding models using various metrics and statistical tests with the help of [ranx](https://github.com/AmenRa/ranx).

Furthermore, we will plot the vector representations to visualize if clusters are being formed and understand how to interpret the p-value that a statistical test provides.

You can find the slides, notebook, and scripts in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ImadSaddik/Benchmark_Embedding_Models). The dataset is available here: [HuggingFace dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ImadSaddik/BenchmarkEmbeddingModelsCourse).
