## Course Overview

This course will teach you how to use [OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine)](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend) for different routing tasks. OSRM is a free and powerful tool that helps you find the shortest route between places, solve the [traveling salesman problem (TSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem), and much more.

You'll learn how to set up OSRM on your computer using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), download a map area to focus your searches, and use OSRM with [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The course is made for beginners, so you don't need any previous experience with OSRM or routing tools.

Here's what you'll learn:

- How to set up OSRM with Docker.
- How to download and prepare map data from any region in the world.
- How to find the shortest path between two points.
- How to generate a distance matrix (table) between multiple locations.
- How to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

All course materials, slides, and Jupyter notebooks are available on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ImadSaddik/OSRM_Course_Python). By the end of the course, you'll know how OSRM works and how to use it in your own projects.
