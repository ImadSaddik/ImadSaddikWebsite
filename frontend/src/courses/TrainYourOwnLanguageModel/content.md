## Course Overview

This course is for beginners who want to understand how [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) (`LLMs`) work and learn how to build one from scratch. We will cover all the steps needed to train a language model, including collecting data, processing it, understanding the [Transformer architecture](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)>), pre-training, and [fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.13296v1).

In this course, I will show you how I trained a language model on [Moroccan Darija](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_Arabic) using a dataset from my conversations with friends. Later, I used a larger dataset from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets) and will explain how to work with big datasets without [running out of memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_memory). Finally, I will show you how to fine-tune the base model on a [Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/en/chapter11/1) dataset to make the model conversational.

Each step is divided into two parts: `theory` and `practice`. The theory is explained in detail in the [slides](https://github.com/ImadSaddik/Train_Your_Language_Model_Course/blob/main/Slides.pdf), and the practical part is available as a Jupyter notebook on [GitHub](https://github.com/ImadSaddik/Train_Your_Language_Model_Course). The course is easy to follow, and I explain each step along the way.

I believe knowledge should be free, so I am sharing this course for free on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel. You can watch the full course below.

Creating courses like this takes months of research, experiments, designing illustrations, recording, and more. If you want to support my mission to share free knowledge, you can also watch the course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/train-your-own-language-model/). The Udemy version has extra content, including quizzes, assignments, and a certificate of completion.
