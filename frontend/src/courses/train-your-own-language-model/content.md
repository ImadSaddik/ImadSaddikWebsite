## Course overview

This course is for beginners who want to understand how [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) (`LLMs`) work and learn how to build one from scratch. We will cover all the steps needed to train a language model, including collecting data, processing it, understanding the [Transformer architecture](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)>), pre-training, and [fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.13296v1).

In this course, I will show you how I trained a language model on [Moroccan Darija](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_Arabic) using a dataset from my conversations with friends. Later, I used a larger dataset from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets) and will explain how to work with big datasets without [running out of memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_memory). Finally, I will show you how to fine-tune the base model on a [Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/en/chapter11/1) dataset to make the model conversational.

Each step is divided into two parts: `theory` and `practice`. The theory is explained in detail in the [slides](https://github.com/ImadSaddik/Train_Your_Language_Model_Course/blob/main/Slides.pdf), and the practical part is available as a Jupyter notebook on [GitHub](https://github.com/ImadSaddik/Train_Your_Language_Model_Course). The course is easy to follow, and I explain each step along the way.
