## Course Overview

This course is for anyone new to [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch). If you have some experience, you'll still find it helpful for building a strong foundation.

Each topic is explained simply, with practical examples you can try on your own computer. We'll connect to Elasticsearch using [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and run Elasticsearch locally in a [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/).

You'll learn about [field data types](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/field-data-types), how to create an index, add documents, and search for them using different methods like [semantic search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_search), [full text search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-text_search), and [hybrid search](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/hybrid-search). You'll also see how to update and delete documents, use aggregations, and much more.

At the end of the course, we'll put everything together in a [final project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsC96vtM5K8&t=32s). You'll work with real data and use Elasticsearch to build a great search feature for a web app made just for this course.

All course materials, slides, and Jupyter notebooks are available on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ImadSaddik/ElasticSearch_Python_Course). By the end, you'll understand how Elasticsearch works and how to use it in your own projects.
