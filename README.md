The source code for my website, [imadsaddik.com](https://imadsaddik.com/), is stored in this repository. The frontend is built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), and the backend uses [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). The site is deployed on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), and the search feature is powered by [Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/).

I created this website to bring together everything I do online. You will find helpful blog posts about programming, courses I have worked on, and astronomy tutorials if you enjoy space 🌝
