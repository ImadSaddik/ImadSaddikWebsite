    <p class="paragraph">
      I'm Imad Saddik from Morocco. I enjoy programming, astronomy, and teaching. I created a YouTube channel called
      3CodeCamp where I share tutorials about cool things I learn, like mobile apps, web development, AI, and more. At
      night, I love looking at the stars and capturing images of the sky.
